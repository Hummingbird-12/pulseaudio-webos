HACKING:
	In order to run pulseaudio from the build dir __OPTIMIZE__ should be
	disabled (look at src/pulsecore/core-util.h::pa_run_from_build_tree()),
	this can be done by passing "CFLAGS=-O0" to the configure script:
	  ./autogen.sh
	  CFLAGS="-ggdb3 -O0" LDFLAGS="-ggdb3" ./configure
	  make
	  ./src/pulseaudio -n -F src/default.pa -p $(pwd)/src/

SPELLING:
